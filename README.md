# Emergency-Dispatch-Using-CCTV-Audio-Processing-and-Machine-Learning-
Conventional emergency dispatch systems often rely on second-hand information, leading to delays and incomplete situational awareness. This paper introduces an intelligent emergency dispatch system that leverages public CCTV infrastructure by integrating real-time audio signal processing and machine learning. The framework utilizes embedded microphones in CCTV units to capture environment audio. An on-device machine learning model analyzes the audio stream to classify signals as either "Distress" or "Non-Distress" based on a preset threshold frequency and the detection of specific keywords. Upon identifying a distress event that exceeds a predetermined confidence threshold, the system automatically transmits an alert, along with location data, to relevant emergency services via a cloud-based framework. The system also features a self-learning architecture, continuously improving model accuracy by using all captured data for retraining. This work presents a viable solution for creating a more proactive and automated emergency response network. Performance of the system is verified by calculating the confusion matrix.
